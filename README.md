In this project I will be creating a simple library app using objects.

The user will be able to add books to the library collection, which will show up and display cards providing them with info on title, author, page, and if they have read it. There will also be remove buttons on each book to remove it from the collection, as well as a 'change read status' button to toggle between if the user has read the book or not.

What I Learned:
-How to manipulate user input through objects in an array
-Setting up input forms and applying data to local variables for manipulation in js
